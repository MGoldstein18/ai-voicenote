## Transcribe Voice Notes with AI
Forward a WhatsApp voice note to 1 (415) 903-5826. The Whisper AI model will transcribe the audio and you'll receive the text as a reply.

Using Whisper through [Banana](https://www.banana.dev/) and using the [Connectly](https://www.connectly.ai/) WhatsApp API.




PS: In theory, audio of any length should be supported however, it has only been tested with audio up to 2 minutes. Once the audio gets to around 1 minute 30 seconds, the transcribed reply will be broken into multiple messages (this is forced by the character limit on the Connectly WhatsApp API) and the ordering of these messages is sometimes off.
